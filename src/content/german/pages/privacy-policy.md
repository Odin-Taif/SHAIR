### Data Protection

The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations as well as this privacy policy.

When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.

We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.

### Notice about the Responsible Party

The responsible party for data processing on this website is:

Airline Assistance Switzerland AG

CH-8058 Zürich-Airport

E-mail: zrh@aas.aero

The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).

### Storage Duration

Unless a more specific storage period has been stated within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for the data processing ceases to apply. If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, provided we have no other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, the deletion will occur after these reasons cease to apply.

### General Information on the Legal Basis of Data Processing on This Website

If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a DSGVO if special data categories according to Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO are processed. In the case of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your terminal device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on § 25 para. 1 TTDSG.

### Data Protection Officer

Airline Assistance Switzerland AG  
Datenschutzbeauftragter

E-mail: data-protection@aas.aero

### Notice Regarding Data Transfer to Third Countries

We use tools from companies based in third countries that are not safe under data protection law, and US tools whose providers are not certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF). When these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to these countries and processed there. We point out that in third countries that are not safe under data protection law, no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed.

We point out that the USA as a safe third country generally has a level of data protection comparable to the EU. A data transfer to the USA is therefore permissible if the recipient has certification under the "EU-US Data Privacy Framework" (DPF) or has suitable additional guarantees. Information about transfers to third countries, including data recipients, can be found in this privacy policy.

### Recipients of Personal Data

In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, the transmission of personal data to these external parties is necessary. We only disclose personal data to external parties if this is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the disclosure under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO, or if another legal basis allows the data disclosure. When using processors, we only disclose personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.

### Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing

Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke your already given consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

### Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Direct Advertising (Art. 21 DSGVO)

If the data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f DSGVO, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The respective legal basis on which a processing is based can be found in this privacy policy. If you object, we will no longer process your affected personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing serves the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims (objection under Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO).

If your personal data are processed for the purpose of direct advertising, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of such advertising at any time; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is associated with such direct advertising. If you object, your personal data will no longer be used for the purpose of direct advertising (objection under Art. 21 para. 2 DSGVO).

### Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority

In the event of violations of the DSGVO, the persons concerned have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.

### Right to Data Portability

You have the right to have data that we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.

### SSL or TLS Encryption

For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's address bar.

If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.

### Information, Deletion, and Correction

Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, their origin, and recipients, and the purpose of the data processing and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of these data. You can contact us at any time regarding this and other questions on the subject of personal data.

### Right to Restriction of Processing

You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:

- If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
- If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
- If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
- If you have lodged an objection under Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO, a balance must be made between your interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests outweigh, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.

If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data may only be processed – apart from their storage – with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.

Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as “cookies.” Cookies are small text files that do not cause any damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or they are permanently archived on your device (permanent cookies). Session cookies are automatically deleted once you terminate your visit. Permanent cookies remain archived on your device until you actively delete them, or they are automatically eradicated by your web browser.

In some cases, third-party cookies may also be stored on your device when you enter our site (third-party cookies). These cookies enable you or us to take advantage of certain services offered by the third party (e.g., cookies for the processing of payment services).

Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically essential since certain website functions would not work in the absence of these cookies (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of videos). The purpose of other cookies may be the analysis of user patterns or the display of promotional messages.

Cookies that are required for the performance of electronic communication transactions (required cookies) or for the provision of certain functions you want to use (functional cookies, e.g., for the shopping cart function) or those that are necessary for the optimization of the website (e.g., cookies that provide measurable insights into the web audience), shall be stored based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO, unless a different legal basis is cited. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure the technically error-free and optimized provision of the operator’s services. If your consent to the storage of the cookies and similar recognition technologies has been requested, processing occurs exclusively based on the consent obtained (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG); this consent may be revoked at any time.

You have the option to set up your browser to notify you every time cookies are placed and to permit the acceptance of cookies only in specific cases. You may also exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain cases or in general or activate the delete function for the automatic eradication of cookies when the browser closes. If cookies are deactivated, the functions of this website may be limited.

In the event that third-party cookies are used or if cookies are used for analytical purposes, we will separately notify you in conjunction with this Data Protection Policy and, if applicable, ask for your consent.

### Contact Form

If you submit inquiries to us via our contact form, the information provided in the contact form, including the contact information provided therein, will be stored by us to handle your inquiry and in the event of follow-up questions. We will not share this information without your consent.

The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO if your request is related to the execution of a contract or if it is necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.

The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain with us until you ask us to delete the data, revoke your consent to the archiving of data, or if the purpose for which the data is being archived no longer exists (e.g., after we have concluded our response to your inquiry). This is without prejudice to any mandatory legal provisions – in particular retention periods.

### Request by E-mail, Telephone, or Fax

If you contact us by e-mail, telephone, or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name, request), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of handling your request. We do not pass these data on without your consent.

The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO if your request is related to the execution of a contract or if it is necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.

The data sent by you to us via contact requests remains with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to its storage, or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g., after your request has been processed). This is without prejudice to any mandatory legal provisions – in particular statutory retention periods.

## 7. Own Services

**Handling Applicant Data**

We offer you the opportunity to apply to us (e.g., via email, postal mail, or online application form). In the following, we inform you about the scope, purpose, and use of your personal data collected during the application process. We assure you that the collection, processing, and use of your data will be carried out in accordance with applicable data protection laws and all other statutory provisions, and your data will be treated with strict confidentiality.

**Scope and Purpose of Data Collection**

If you send us an application, we process your associated personal data (e.g., contact and communication data, application documents, notes from job interviews, etc.) as far as this is necessary for the decision on the establishment of an employment relationship. The legal basis for this is § 26 BDSG under German law (initiation of an employment relationship), Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR (general contract initiation) and – if you have given consent – Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. Consent can be revoked at any time. Your personal data will only be passed on within our company to persons who are involved in processing your application.

If the application is successful, the data submitted by you will be stored in our data processing systems on the basis of § 26 BDSG and Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR for the purpose of carrying out the employment relationship.

**Data Retention Period**

If we are unable to make you a job offer, you reject a job offer, or withdraw your application, we reserve the right to retain the data you have submitted on the basis of our legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) for up to 6 months from the end of the application process (rejection or withdrawal of the application). Afterwards, the data will be deleted and the physical application documents will be destroyed. The retention serves in particular as evidence in the event of a legal dispute. If it is evident that the data will be required after the 6-month period has expired (e.g., due to a pending or imminent legal dispute), deletion will only take place once the purpose for further retention no longer applies.

A longer retention can also take place if you have given corresponding consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) or if statutory retention obligations oppose deletion.

**Inclusion in the Applicant Pool**

If we do not make you a job offer, there may be the possibility to include you in our applicant pool. In case of inclusion, all documents and information from the application will be transferred to the applicant pool in order to contact you in case of suitable vacancies.

Inclusion in the applicant pool is based exclusively on your express consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). The submission of consent is voluntary and is not related to the ongoing application process. The data subject can revoke their consent at any time. In this case, the data from the applicant pool will be irrevocably deleted, provided there are no statutory retention reasons.

The data from the applicant pool will be irrevocably deleted no later than two years after consent has been granted.
